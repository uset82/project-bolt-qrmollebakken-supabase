## How It Works

### 1. Teacher Upload Process
1. Teacher selects a student from the dropdown
2. Chooses media type (image/video/audio)
3. Enters title and optional description
4. Uploads media file
5. Real-time progress tracking
6. Automatic quota validation
7. Success/error notifications

### 2. Parent Access Process
1. Parent receives unique QR code
2. Scans QR code using the application
3. Automatic authentication
4. Redirected to personal gallery
5. Views child's artwork chronologically

### 3. Media Management
- Unique file naming using UUID
- Organized storage structure
- Automatic file type validation
- Size and duration checks
- Quota enforcement

### 4. Storage Structure
```
students/
  ├── [student-name]/
  │   ├── images/
  │   │   ├── [timestamp]-[uuid].jpg
  │   │   ├── [timestamp]-[uuid].png
  │   ├── videos/
  │   │   └── [timestamp]-[uuid].mp4
  │   └── audio/
  │       └── [timestamp]-[uuid].mp3
```
